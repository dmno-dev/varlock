import SyncedCodeTabs from "@/components/SyncedCodeTabs.astro";

`varlock` makes your environment variables validated and secure. It is based on the [env-spec](https://github.com/dmno-dev/env-spec) standard.

There are two ways to install `varlock`:

1. Install as a dependency in javascript/typescript projects
2. Install as a binary in other languages

## As a js/ts dependency

Requires:

- OSX or Linux (WSL supported)
- Node.js version 22 or higher

### Installation

To install `varlock` in your project, run:

<SyncedCodeTabs
  group="package-manager"
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "npm",
      code: "npx varlock init",
      lang: "bash",
    },
    {
      label: "yarn",
      code: "yarn dlx varlock init",
      lang: "bash",
    },
    {
      label: "pnpm",
      code: "pnpm dlx varlock init",
      lang: "bash",
    },
  ]}
/>

This will install `varlock` as a dependency and scan your project for `.env` files and create a `.env.schema` file in the root of your project. It will optionally:
- Remove your existing `.env.example` file
- Add decorators to your `.env.schema` file to specify the type of each environment variable
- Install the `varlock` CLI binary
- Install the desktop app
- Encrypt secrets in your `.env` file

## As a binary

To install Varlock as a binary, run:

```bash
brew install varlock
```

This will install the `varlock` CLI binary and the desktop app.
## Desktop App

The `varlock` CLI also includes a desktop app that hooks into system level APIs to encrypt and decrypt environment variables. This means that you never have secrets sitting in plaintext on your system.
