description: Using varlock with AI tools - preventing secrets from being leaked to your AI agents

AI tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) have accelerated workflows for many development teams. This, however, comes with some risks. Unless your team has gone to great lengths to hide secrets from your AI tools, you're probably sending secrets to their AI agents and potentially leaking them in the code it generates.

`varlock` exists to solve both of those problems. By never storing the secret _values_, you never have to worry about sending them to AI servers. And because of the new [@env-spec](/env-spec/overview) format you will have better AX (agent experience) when dealing with environment variables.

## Allowing schema files for AI tools

Most AI tools ignore `.env.*` files by default. To ensure your AI tool can access your environment schema, add the following to your `.gitignore`:

```txt
!.env.schema
```

If you use a tool with its own ignore file, check that tool's documentation to see how it handles ignore files and make sure `.env.schema` is allowed.

## Custom instructions and rules

To give your AI tool full context about `varlock`, you can provide it with the [full Varlock `llms.txt`](https://varlock.dev/llms-full.txt). In Cursor, this is accomplished via 'Add New Custom Docs'. 

If your tool supports custom rules, you can use our own varlock [Cursor rule file from this repo](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/blob/main/.cursor/rules/varlock.mdc) as a starting point to create your own that is most suited to your workflow.
