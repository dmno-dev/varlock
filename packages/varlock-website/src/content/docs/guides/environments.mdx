description: Best practices for managing multiple environments with varlock
---

One of the main benefits of using environment variables is the ability to boot your application with configuration intended for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production, test).

You can use functions and environment-specific `.env` files (e.g., `.env.production`) to alter configuration accordingly in a declarative way. Plus the additional guardrails provided by `varlock` also make this much safer no matter how values are set.

While many have traditionally shied away from using environment-specific `.env` files due to fear of committing sensitive values, the new ability to set values using [functions](/reference/functions) makes it much easier to manage these values in a secure way.


### Process overrides
`varlock` will always treat environment variables passed into the process with the most precedence. This means you can rely on your external hosting platform to inject environment-specific values and still benefit from `varlock`'s validation and coercion logic.

However we recommend using injected overrides sparingly, and instead moving more config into your schema and environment-specific files.


### Loading environment-specific `.env` files

`varlock` automatically detects all `.env.*` files in the current directory. However only files which are not environment-specific (e.g., `.env.schema`, `.env.local`) and environment-specific files (e.g., `.env.development`) that match the current [`@envFlag`](/reference/root-decorators/#envflag) will be applied.

The files are applied with a specific precedence (increasing):
- `.env.schema` - your schema file
- `.env.[envFlag]` - environment-specific values
- `.env.local` - local gitignored overrides
- `.env.[envFlag].local` - environment-specific local overrides

For example, with the following `.env.schema`:
```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# @envFlag=APP_ENV
# ---
# @type=enum(development, test, staging, production)
APP_ENV=development
```

In order to load and apply your env vars for a specific environment, you must set your environment flag, usually using an override passed into the process. For example:

```bash
APP_ENV=test varlock run -- node my-test-script.js
```

## Advanced logic with remap() and regex()

You can use the [`remap()`](/reference/functions#remap) and [`regex()`](/reference/functions#regex) functions to handle more complex environment-specific logic in your configuration. This is especially useful when you don't have control over build or boot commands. 

For example, with Cloudflare Workers builds: 

```env-spec
# .env.schema
# @envFlag=APP_ENV
# ---
# env var that is set by Cloudfare
WORKERS_CI_BRANCH=
# @type=enum(development, preview, production)
APP_ENV=remap($WORKERS_CI_BRANCH, production="main", preview=regex(.*), development=undefined)

```

This will allow you set your `APP_ENV` based on the the value of `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH`. In this case, if `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH` is set to `main`, `APP_ENV` will be set to `production`. If `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH` is set to anything else, `APP_ENV` will be set to `preview`. If `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH` is not set, for example in local development, `APP_ENV` will be set to `development`.

## Setting the default environment flag

You can set the default environment flag directly when running CLI commands using the `varlock load --env` flag:

```bash
varlock load --env production
```

This is useful for scripting or CI/CD pipelines where you want to explicitly control which environment configuration is loaded and you have full control over the build or boot commands.

:::caution
Note this will be overridden by the `envFlag` in your `.env.schema` file.
