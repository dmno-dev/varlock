## Config item values

You may set config items values using _functions_ rather than simple static values. Functions can be composed together to create complex value resolution logic.
```env-spec
ITEM=fn(arg1, arg2)
COMPOSITION=fn1(fn1Arg1, fn2(fn2Arg1, fn2Arg2))
```


Note that many built-in utility functions have _expansion_ equivalents and often it will be more clear to use them that way. For example:
```env-spec
EXPANSION_EQUIVALENT="pre-${OTHER}-post"
USING_FN_CALLS=concat("pre-", ref(OTHER), "-post")

# mixed example
CONFIG=exec(`aws ssm get-parameter --name "/config/${APP_ENV}" --with-decryption`)
```





Currently, there are built-in utility functions, and soon there will be functions to handle values encrypted using varlock provided tools.

In the future, plugins will be able to register additional functions that fetch values from external providers.


{/* ## varlock()

The `varlock()` function is used to handle encrypted values. It decrypts the provided encrypted string at runtime.

```env-spec
# @sensitive
API_KEY=varlock("encrypted_string_here")
```

### Arguments
- `encrypted_string` (string, required): The encrypted value to be decrypted

```env-spec
# @sensitive
DATABASE_PASSWORD=varlock("oipjfdopiajpfoidjpaoijpofdjpoa...")
``` */}

### `concat()`

Concatenates multiple values into a single string.

Expansion uses `concat()` to combine multiple parts of strings when they include multiple parts.

```env-spec "concat"
PATH=concat("base/", ref("APP_ENV"), "/config.json")
PATH2=`base/${APP_ENV}/config.json` # equivalent using expansion
```
</div>

<div>
### `exec()`

Executes a CLI command and uses its output as the value. This is particularly useful for integrating with external tools and services.

NOTE - many CLI tools output an additional newline. `exec()` will trim this automatically.

Expansion equivalent: `exec(command)` === `$(command)`

```env-spec "exec"
# Using 1Password CLI
API_KEY=exec(`op read "op://dev test/service x/api key"`)
# Using AWS CLI
AWS_CREDENTIALS=exec(`aws sts get-session-token --profile prod`)
```
</div>

<div>
### `ref()`

References another environment variable - which is very useful when composing multiple functions together.

Expansion equivalent: `ref(OTHER_VARL)` === `${OTHER_VAR}` (and `$OTHER_VAR`)

```env-spec "ref"
API_URL=https://api.example.com
USERS_API_URL=concat(ref("API_URL"), "/users")
```
</div>

<div>
### `fallback()`

Returns the first non-empty value in a list of possible values.

```env-spec "fallback"
POSSIBLY_EMPTY=
ANOTHER=
EXAMPLE=fallback(ref(POSSIBLY_EMPTY), ref(ANOTHER), "default-val")
```
</div>

<div>
### `remap()`

Maps a value to a new value based on a set of remapping rules. This is useful for translating one value, often provided by an external platform, into another.

- The first argument is the value to remap (often a `ref()` to another variable).
- All following arguments are key=value pairs, where the key is the new value and the value is what to match against, which can be a string, `undefined`, or a `regex()` call.
- If no match is found, the original value is returned.

```env-spec "remap"
# env var that is set by CI/platform
CI_BRANCH=

# @type=enum(development, preview, production)
APP_ENV=remap($CI_BRANCH, production="main", preview=regex(.*), development=undefined)
```
</div>

<div>
### `regex()`

Creates a regular expression for use in other functions, such as `remap()`.

- Takes a single string argument, which is the regex pattern (using JavaScript regex syntax)
- **This cannot be used as a standalone value. It must be used only as a function argument.**

```env-spec "regex"
# Example usage within remap
ENV_TYPE=remap($APP_ENV, dev=regex("^dev.*"), prod="production")
```
</div>
</div>

## Decorator values
Similarly, some @decorators can accept a function call as a value, allowing for a more expressive options.
These are not standardized, and many functions may be specific to only a single decorator, for example [`@type` data types](/reference/data-types/), 
but there are a few functions that may be used across several decorators, so we will document them here:

<div class="reference-docs">
<div>
### `forEnv()`

Resolves to a boolean, if the current [environment flag value](/reference/root-decorators/#envflag) matches any in the
list passed in as args.

**Requirements:**
- May be used with [`@required`](/reference/item-decorators/#required), [`@optional`](/reference/item-decorators/#optional), and [`@disable`](/reference/root-decorators/#disable) decorators
- Requires an [`@envFlag`](/reference/root-decorators/#envflag) to be set in your `.env.schema` file
- Takes one or more environment names as arguments

```env-spec /forEnv\\(.*\\)/
# @envFlag=APP_ENV @defaultRequired=false
# @disable=forEnv(test)  # entire file will be disabled if env is test
# ---
APP_ENV=staging

# Required only in development
# @required=forEnv(development)
DEV_API_KEY=

# Required in staging and production  
# @required=forEnv(staging, production)
PROD_API_KEY=

# Optional in development, required otherwise
# @optional=forEnv(development)
DEBUG_FLAG=
```
</div>
</div>
