import ExecCommandWidget from "@/components/ExecCommandWidget.astro";

## Basics

The basic workflow for using Varlock is to:

1. Run [`varlock init`](/reference/cli-commands/#init) to set up your `.env.schema` file
2. Run [`varlock load`](/reference/cli-commands/#load) to debug and refine your .env file(s)
3. Use Varlock to load, validate, and inject env vars into your application, either:
    - Use an [existing framework / tool integration](/integrations/overview/) that automatically calls Varlock under the hood (_recommended_)
    - Use `import 'varlock/auto-load'` in a backend JavaScript/TypeScript project
    - Boot your command via [`varlock run`](/reference/cli-commands/#run)<br/>(_necessary for non-JS/TS projects, or feeding env vars to external tools_)


## CLI Commands

### `varlock load`

<ExecCommandWidget command="varlock load" />

Validates your environment variables according to your `.env.schema` and associated `.env.*` files, and prints the results.

Useful for debugging locally, and in CI to print out a summary of env vars, also when you're authoring your `.env.schema` file and want immediate feedback.

:::tip
Our [integrations](/integrations/overview) all use `varlock load` under the hood, so you'll get the same developer experience, but typically they will only let you know if there are errors, rather than the full summary.

See the [`varlock load` CLI Reference](/reference/cli-commands/#load) for more information.

### `varlock run`

<ExecCommandWidget command="varlock run -- <your-command>" />

Executes a command in a child process, injecting your resolved and validated environment variables. This is useful when a code-level integration is not possible. For example, if you're using a database migration tool, you can use `varlock run` to run the migration tool with the correct environment variables. Or if you're using a non-js/ts language, you can use `varlock run` to run a command and inject validated environment variables.
