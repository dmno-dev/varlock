There are two ways to install `varlock`:

1. Install as a `package.json` dependency in JavaScript/TypeScript projects
2. Install as a standalone binary

## As a JavaScript/TypeScript dependency

Requires:
- Node.js version 22 or higher

### Installation

To install `varlock` in your project, run:

<ExecCommandWidget command="varlock init" showBinary={false} dlx={true} />

This will install `varlock` as a dependency and scan your project for `.env` files and create a `.env.schema` file in the root of your project. Depending on your project configuration, it will optionally:
- Remove your existing `.env.example` file
- Add decorators to your `.env.schema` file to specify the type of each environment variable
{/* - Encrypt secrets in your `.env` file */}

## As a standalone binary

To install `varlock` CLI as a binary, run:

```bash
# Install via homebrew
brew install dmno-dev/tap/varlock

# OR via cURL
curl -sSfL https://varlock.dev/install.sh | sh -s
```

Then run the setup wizard to help you get started:
```bash
varlock init
```

You can then run `varlock --help` to see the available commands or read the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli-commands/).

{/* ## Desktop app

The `varlock` CLI also includes a desktop app that hooks into system level APIs to encrypt and decrypt environment variables. This means that you never have secrets sitting in plaintext on your system.

:::tip[MacOS Only]
During our beta phase, the desktop app is only available on macOS. Windows and Linux users can use the CLI without the desktop app.
