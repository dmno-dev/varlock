description: Using the schema to manage your environment variables
---

One of the core features of varlock is its schema-driven approach to environment variables - which is best when shared with your team and committed to version control. We recommend creating a new `.env.schema` file to hold schema info set by [config item decorators](/reference/item-decorators), non-sensitive default values, and [root decorators](/reference/root-decorators) to specify global settings that affect `varlock` itself.

This schema should include all of the environment variables that your application depends on, along with comments and documentation about them, and decorators which affect coercion, validation, and generated types / documentation.

The more complete your schema is, the more validation and coercion `varlock` can perform, and the more it can help you catch errors earlier in your development cycle.

> Running [`varlock init`](/reference/cli-commands#init) will attempt to convert an existing `.env.example` file into a `.env.schema` file. It must be reviewed, but it should be a good starting point.


## Root Decorators
The _header_ section of a `.env` file is a comment block at the beginning of the file that ends with a divider. Within this header, you can use [root decorators](/reference/root-decorators) to specify global settings and default behavior for all config items.

```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# This is the header, and may contain root decorators
# @envFlag=APP_ENV
# @defaultSensitive=false @defaultRequired=false
# @generateTypes(lang=ts, path=env.d.ts)
# ---

# This is a config item comment block and may contain decorators which affect only the item
# @required @type=enum(dev, test, staging, prod)
APP_ENV=dev
```

## Config Items

Config items are the environment variables that your application depends on. Like normal `.env` syntax, each item is a key-value pair of the form `KEY=value`. The key is the name of the environment variable, and a value may be specified or not. 

While simply enumerating all of them in your `.env.schema` is useful (like a `.env.example` file), [@env-spec](/env-spec/) allows us to attach additional comments and [item decorators](/reference/item-decorators), making our schema much more powerful.


### Item Values
Values may be static, or set using [functions](/reference/functions), which can facilitate loading values from external sources without exposing any sensitive values.

**Quote rules:**
- Static values can be wrapped in quotes or not -- all quotes styles (<code>\`</code>, `"`, `'`) are supported
- Values wrapped in single quotes do not support [expansion](#expansion)
- Single line values may not contain newlines, but `\n` will be converted to an actual newline except in single quotes
- Multiline values can be wrapped in <code>```</code>, `"""`. Also supported is `"` and `'` but not recommended.
- Unquoted values will be parsed as a number/boolean/undefined where possible (`ITEM=foo` -> `"foo"`, while `ITEM=true` -> `true`), however data-types may further coerce values
- No value (undefined) and empty string ("") are distinct

```env-spec title=".env.schema"
NO_VALUE= # will resolve to undefined
EMPTY_STRING_VALUE="" # will resolve to empty string
STATIC_VALUE_UNQUOTED=quotes are optional # but are recommended!
STATIC_VALUE_QUOTED="#hashtag" # and are necessary in some cases
BOOLEAN_VALUE=true
NUMERIC_VALUE=123.456
FUNCTION_VALUE=exec(`op read "op://api-config/item/credential"`)
MULTILINE_VALUE="""
multiple
lines
"""
```

### Item comments
Comments are used to attach additional documentation and metadata to config items using [item decorators](/reference/item-decorators). This additional metadata is used by varlock to perform validation, coercion, and generate types / documentation.

Multiple comment lines _directly_ preceeding an item will be attached to that item. A blank line or a divider (`# ---`) break a comment block, and detach it from the following config item.
Comment lines can either contain regular comments or [item decorators](/reference/item-decorators). Note that if a line does not start with a decorator, it will be treated as a regular comment.

```env-spec
# description of item can be multiple lines
# this @decorator will be ignored because the line does not start with @
# @sensitive=false @required # decorator lines can end with a comment
# @type=string(startsWith=pk-) # multiple lines of decorators are allowed
SERVICE_X_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk-abc123
```

### Value Expansion ||expansion||

`varlock` supports _expansion_ like other .env tools - such as [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand). However unlike other tools, it uses [function calls](/reference/functions) to implement this.

- `prefix-${OTHER}` -> `concat("prefix", ref("OTHER"))`
- `${OTHER}` -> `ref("OTHER")`
- `${OTHER:-defaultval}` -> `fallback(ref("OTHER"), "defaultval")`
- `$(whoami)` -> `exec("whoami")`

While you could call those functions directly, in many cases it will be more clear to use expansion, or a mix of function calls and expansion. For example:

```env-spec
OP_VAULT_NAME=api-config-prod
MY_KEY=exec(`op read "op://${OP_VAULT_NAME}/service/api-key"`)
```
