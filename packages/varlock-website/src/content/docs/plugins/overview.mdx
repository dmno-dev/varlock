Plugins allow extending the functionality of Varlock. See the [plugins guide](/guides/plugins/) for more details on using plugins.

For now, only official Varlock plugins under the `@varlock` npm scope are supported. We plan to support third-party plugins in the future, along with loading plugins from different sources (e.g., local files, git, npm/jsr, http, etc.).

## Official plugins
- [1Password](/plugins/1password/)
- [AWS Secrets Manager](/plugins/aws-secrets/) (includes Parameter Store support)
- [Azure Key Vault](/plugins/azure-key-vault/)
- [Bitwarden](/plugins/bitwarden/)
- [Google Secrets Manager](/plugins/google-secret-manager/)
- [Infisical](/plugins/infisical/)

## Roadmap

We have plans to build official plugins for more secret management systems, including:
- Simple encrypted vault (using local files)
- HashiCorp Vault
