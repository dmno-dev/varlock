There are two ways to install `varlock`:

1. Install as a dependency in JavaScript/TypeScript projects
2. Install as a standalone binary

## As a JavaScript/TypeScript dependency

Requires:

- Node.js version 22 or higher

### Installation

To install `varlock` in your project, run:

<SyncedCodeTabs
  group="package-manager"
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "npm",
      code: "npx varlock init",
      lang: "bash",
    },
    {
      label: "yarn",
      code: "yarn dlx varlock init",
      lang: "bash",
    },
    {
      label: "pnpm",
      code: "pnpm dlx varlock init",
      lang: "bash",
    },
  ]}
/>

This will install `varlock` as a dependency and scan your project for `.env` files and create a `.env.schema` file in the root of your project. Depending on your project configuration, it will optionally:
- Remove your existing `.env.example` file
- Add decorators to your `.env.schema` file to specify the type of each environment variable
- Install the desktop app
- Encrypt secrets in your `.env` file

## As a binary

To install Varlock as a binary, run:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://varlock.dev/install.sh | sh -s
```

This will install the `varlock` CLI binary and (optionally) the desktop app.

{/* ## Desktop app

The `varlock` CLI also includes a desktop app that hooks into system level APIs to encrypt and decrypt environment variables. This means that you never have secrets sitting in plaintext on your system.

:::tip[MacOS Only]
During our beta phase, the desktop app is only available on macOS. Windows and Linux users can use the CLI without the desktop app.
