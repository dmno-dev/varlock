description: Best practices for managing multiple environments with varlock
---

One of the main benefits of using environment variables is the ability to boot your application with configuration intended for different environments (e.g., development, preview, staging, production, test).

You can use functions and environment-specific `.env` files (e.g., `.env.production`) to alter configuration accordingly in a declarative way. Plus the additional guardrails provided by `varlock` also make this much safer no matter how values are set.

While many have traditionally shied away from using environment-specific `.env` files due to fear of committing sensitive values, the new ability to set values using [functions](/reference/functions) makes it much easier to manage these values in a secure way.


### Process overrides
`varlock` will always treat environment variables passed into the process with the most precedence. This means you can rely on your external hosting platform to inject environment-specific values and still benefit from `varlock`'s validation and coercion logic.

However we recommend using injected overrides sparingly, and instead moving more config into your `.env` files.


### Loading environment-specific `.env` files

`varlock` automatically detects all `.env.*` files in the current directory. However any environment-specific files (e.g., `.env.development`) will only be loaded if they match the value of the env var set by the [`@envFlag`](/reference/root-decorators/#envflag) root decorator.

The files are applied with a specific precedence (increasing):
- `.env.schema` - your schema file, which can also contain default values
- `.env` - default values only (not recommended)
- `.env.[envFlag]` - environment-specific values
- `.env.local` - local overrides (gitignored)
- `.env.[envFlag].local` - environment-specific local overrides (gitignored)

For example, consider the following `.env.schema`:
```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# @envFlag=APP_ENV
# ---
# @type=enum(development, test, staging, production)
APP_ENV=development
```

Your environment flag key is set to `APP_ENV`, which has a default value of `development`. By default, `.env.development` and `.env.development.local` will be loaded if they exist.

To tell `varlock` to load `.env.staging` instead, you must set `APP_ENV` to `staging` - usually using an override passed into the process. For example:

```bash
APP_ENV=staging varlock run -- node my-test-script.js
```

## Advanced logic using functions

On some platforms, you may not have full control over a build or boot command or the env vars passed into them.
In this case, we can use functions to transform other env vars provided by the platform into the environment flag value we want.
We can use [`remap()`](/reference/functions#remap) to transform a value according to a lookup, along with [`regex()`](/reference/functions#regex) if we need to match a pattern instead of an exact value.

For example, on the Cloudflare Workers CI platform, we get the current branch name injected as `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH`, which we can use to determine which environment to load:

```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# @envFlag=APP_ENV
# ---
# set to current branch name when build is running on Cloudflare CI, empty otherwise
WORKERS_CI_BRANCH=
# @type=enum(development, preview, production, test)
APP_ENV=remap($WORKERS_CI_BRANCH, production="main", preview=regex(.*), development=undefined)
```

You'll notice that `test` is one of the possible enum values, but it is not listed in the remap.
When running tests, you would just explicitly set `APP_ENV` when invoking your command.

```bash
APP_ENV=test varlock run -- your-test-command
# or if your command is loading varlock internally
APP_ENV=test your-test-command
```

or you could run a production style build locally `APP_ENV=production varlock run -- your-build-command`

## Setting a _default_ environment flag

You can set the default environment flag directly when running CLI commands using the `--env` flag:

```bash
varlock load --env production
```

This is only useful if you do not want to create a new env var for your env flag, and you are only using varlock via CLI commands. 
Mostly it is used internally by some integrations to match existing default behavior, and should not be used otherwise.

:::caution
If `@envFlag` is used, this will be ignored!
