description: Integrating varlock into other languages
---

To use varlock with other languages, you'll likely want to [install the standalone binary](/getting-started/installation/#as-a-binary), rather than using a JS package manager.

To use it with your applciation code, you must use [`varlock run`](/reference/cli-commands/#varlock-run) to load and validate your environment variables, then run the command you provided with those environment variables injected into the process.

```bash
varlock run -- <your-command>
```

We are working on language-specific helper libraries, that will make this integration better, and provide additional security features like we do in JavaScript.

We will also be implementing automatic type-generation based on your schema for various languages.
