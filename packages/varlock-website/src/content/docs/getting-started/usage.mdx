## Basics

The basic workflow for using varlock is to:

1. Run `varlock init` to set up your `.env.schema` file(s)
2. Run `varlock load` to validate your environment variables
3. Run `varlock run` to valid and inject your environment variables into your command


:::tip
In most cases, you'll want to use an integration to handle the loading and validation of environment variables for you. See the [Integrations](/integrations/overview) section for more information.

## CLI Commands

### `varlock load`

<ExecCommandWidget command="varlock load" />

Validates your environment variables according to your `.env.schema` and associated `.env.*` files, and prints the results.

Useful for debugging locally, and in CI to print out a summary of env vars, also when you're authoring your `.env.schema` file and want immediate feedback. 

:::tip
Our [integrations](/integrations/overview) all use `varlock load` under the hood, so you'll get the same developer experience, but typically they will only let you know if there are errors, rather than the full summary.

See the [`varlock load` CLI Reference](/reference/cli-commands/#varlock-load) for more information.

### `varlock run`

<ExecCommandWidget command="varlock run -- <your-command>" />

Executes a command in a child process, injecting your resolved and validated environment variables. This is useful when a code-level integration is not possible. For example, if you're using a database migration tool, you can use `varlock run` to run the migration tool with the correct environment variables. Or if you're using a non-js/ts language, you can use `varlock run` to run a command and inject validated environment variables.
