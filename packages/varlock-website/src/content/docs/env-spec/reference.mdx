We don't make any assumptions about the meaning of specific decorators, or function calls.
Comments

Comments in env-spec (like dotenv) start with a `#`. Comments can be either on their own line, or at the end of a line after something else.
- `# this is a comment`
- `KEY=val # so is this`
- `  # but this is invalid` 

We give these comments additional meaning by letting them contain `@decorators` and attaching them to specific config items.

`Comment`
A regular comment is a comment that does not start with `@`
- Leading whitespace is optional -- `#these`, `# are`, `#    all valid `
- Decorators within are ignored -- `# this @decorator is ignored`

`DecoratorComment`
A decorator comment is a comment that starts with an `@` and contains decorators
- It may contain one or multiple decorators -- `# @type=integer`, `# @sensitive @required`
- There may be an additional regular comment after the decorator(s) -- `# @sensitive=false   # key is published in final build`
`Divider`
A divider is a comment that serves as a separator, like a horizontal line
- A comment starting with `---` or `===` is considered a divider -- `# ---`, `# ===`
- A _single_ leading whitespace is optional -- `# ---`, `#---`
- Anything after that is ignored and valid -- `# --- some info`, `# ------------`
`CommentBlock`
A comment block is a group of continuous comments that is not attached to a specific config item.
- The comment block is ended by an empty line, a `Divider`, or the end of the file.
- Both `DecoratorComment`s and `RegularComment`s may be interpersed

`DocumentHeader`
If a `CommentBlock` ends with a `Divider` and is the first element of the document, it will be considered the Header.
- Decorators from this header can be used to configure all contained elements, or the loading process itself


### Decorators

A `Decorator` is used within comments to attach structured data to specific config items or to the entire document and loading process.

- Each decorator has a name and optional value -- `@name=value`
- Using the name only is equivalent to setting the value to true -- `@required` === `@required=true`
- Decorator values will be parsed using the common value-handling rules (see below)

**Valid decorator examples:**
```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# @willBeTrue @willBeFalse=false @explicitTrue=true @undef=undefined @trueString="true"
# @int=123 @float=123.456 @willBeString=123.456.789
# @doubleQuoted="with spaces" @singleQuote='hi' @backTickQuote=`hi`
# @unquoted=this-works-too @withNewline="new\nline"
# @funcCallNoArgs=func() @dec=funcCallArray(val1, "val2") @dec=funcCallObj(k1=v1, k2="v2")
```

**Invalid decorator examples:**
```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# @
# @int=
# @noNewLines="new
#              laksdjf"
```

### Config Items

Config items define individual env vars.
Each has a key, an optional value, and optional attached comments.

- Keys must start with [a-ZA-Z_], followed by any of [a-ZA-Z0-9_] -- ✅ `SOME_ITEM`, ❌ `BAD-KEY`, ❌ `2BAD_KEY`
- Setting no value is allowed and will be treated as `undefined` -- `UNDEF_VAR=`
- An explicit empty string is allowed -- `EMPTY_STRING_VAR=""`
- Single-line values may be wrapped in quotes or not, and will follow the common value-handling rules (see below)
- Multi-line string values may be wrapped in either ``( ' | " | """ | ``` )`` - but we **strongly** recommend using triple backticks only for consistency
- Only comments _directly_ preceeding the item will be attached to the item
- However a `Divider` will break the above comments into a `CommentBlock` that is not attached to the item
- An additional post-comment can appear after an item `ITEM1=foo # post comment`
  - This post-comment may contain decorators too `ITEM1=foo # @required` (not recommended)

### Common Value-Handling Rules

Values are interpreted similarly for config item values, decorator values, and values within function call arguments. Values may be wrapped in quotes or not, but handling varies slightly.

- Values may never contain actual newlines, but may contain the string `\n`
- Values do not have to be wrapped in quotes if they do not contain spaces
- Unquoted values also may not contain other characters depending on the context:
  - `ConfigItem` values may not contain `[ #]`
  - `Decorator` values may not contain `[ #]`
  - `FunctionCall` args may not contain `[ ,)]`
- Unquoted values will coerce `true`, `false`, `undefined` -- `@foo=false`
- Unquoted values will coerce numeric values -- `@int=123 @float=123.456`
- Otherwise unquoted values will be treated as a string
- A value in quotes is _always_ be treated as a string -- `@d1="with spaces" @trueString="true"`, `@numStr="123"`
- All quote styles ``[`'"]`` are ok -- ``@dq="c" @bt=`b` @sq='a'``
- Escaped quotes matching the wrapping quote style are ok -- `@ok="escaped\"quote"`
- In quote-wrapped values, the string `\n` will be converted to an actual newline

### Function calls

If a value is not wrapped in quotes and looks like a function call - for example `encrypted(ASDF123...)` - we will interpret it as a `FunctionCall`. This is relevant both for config item values and decorator values.

- function names must start with a letter, and can then contain letters, numbers, and underscores `/[a-ZA-Z][a-ZA-Z0-9_]*/`
- function args are always interpreted as either an array or object
- you can pass no args, a single value, or multiple
- or you may pass key value pairs, and the args will be interpreted as an object
- each value will be interpreted using common value-handling rules (see above)

**Examples:**
```env-spec title=".env.schema functions"
# @noArgs=fn()
# @oneArg=fn(asdf) @oneArgQuoted=fn("with quotes")
# @multipleArgs=fn(one, "two", three, 123.456)
# @objArgs=fn(key1=v1, key2="v2", key3=true)
```
