title: Integrations Overview
description: How Varlock integrates with popular frameworks, bundlers, and runtimes
---

Varlock ships with official integrations that wire the CLI, runtime helpers, and framework-specific plugins together so your configuration is validated, type-safe, and protected everywhere it runs.

Integrations allow you to:
- load and validate `.env` files automatically during dev and use them in CI/CD and production.
- inject config into your code at build or request time.
- enable runtime protections such as leak prevention, and log redaction.

## Official integrations
- [JavaScript / Node.js](/integrations/javascript/) — use `varlock` in custom toolchains, scripts, and servers.
- [Next.js](/integrations/nextjs/) — drop-in replacement for `@next/env`.
- [Vite](/integrations/vite/) — Vite plugin that validates and replaces at build time.
- [Qwik](/integrations/vite/) — Use the Vite integration.
- [React Router](/integrations/vite/) — Use the Vite integration.
- [Cloudflare Workers](/integrations/vite/) — Use the Vite intregration + Cloudflare Vite plugin.
- [Astro](/integrations/astro/) — Astro integration built on top of our Vite plugin.
- [GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-action/) — Validate your `.env.schema` in GitHub Actions workflows
- [Other languages](/integrations/other-languages/) — guidance for piping varlock output into non-JS runtimes.
- [Docker](/guides/docker/) — A Docker wrapper around the varlock CLI including examples. 


## Coming soon
We’re actively working on additional first-party integrations for popular runtimes, frameworks and hosting platforms. If yours isn’t listed yet, let us know!
