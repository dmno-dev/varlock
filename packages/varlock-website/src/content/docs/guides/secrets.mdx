description: Best practices for managing secrets and sensitive environment variables with varlock
---

`varlock` uses the term _sensitive_ to describe any value that should not be exposed to the outside world. This includes secret api keys, passwords, and other generally sensitive information. Instead of relying on prefixes (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) to know which items may be "public", varlock relies on `@decorators` to mark sensitive items explicitly.

{/* For local development, `varlock` allows you to encrypt sensitive values in your `.env.*` files using `varlock encrypt` and then decrypt them using `varlock load` or `varlock run`.

This (currently) works exclusively for local development since it relies on encryption keys stored on your system. */}

:::tip[Coming soon]
We'll be adding support for our own trustless, cloud-based secret storage in the very near future.

{/* ## Encryption via `varlock`

1. [Install](/getting-started/installation) `varlock` including the desktop app
2. Add sensitive values to your `.env.*` file(s)
3. Encrypt them using `varlock encrypt`
4. Decrypt them using `varlock load` or `varlock run` */}

## Marking `@sensitive` items
Whether each item is sensitive or not is controlled by the [`@defaultSensitive`](/reference/root-decorators/#defaultsensitive) root decorator and the [`@sensitive`](/reference/item-decorators/#sensitive) item decorator. Whether you want to default to sensitive or not, or infer based on key names is up to you. For example:

```diff lang="env-spec" title=".env.schema"
# @defaultSensitive=false
# ---
# not sensitive by default (because of the root decorator)
NON_SECRET_FOO=
# @sensitive # explicitly marking this item as sensitive
SECRET_FOO=
```

## Using 3rd party tools

`varlock` is compatible with any 3rd party tool that supports fetching secrets via a CLI. With `exec`function syntax, you can use any 3rd party tool to fetch secrets.

Here's an example using 1Password:

```bash
# A secret in 1Password
# @sensitive @required
MY_SECRET=exec(`op read "op://devTest/myVault/credential"`);
```

This way no secrets are ever left in plaintext on your system, even if they are gitignored. 

## Security enhancements
Unlike other tools where you have to rely on pattern matching to detect _sensitive-looking_ data, `varlock` knows exactly which values are sensitive, and can take extra precautions to protect them.

For example, some of the features supported by our libraries and integrations:
- Redact sensitive values from logs
- Scan client-facing bundled code at build time
- Scan outgoing HTTP responses at runtime
{/* - Scan outgoing HTTP requests to ensure API keys are sent to the right destination only */}
{/* - Pre-commit git hooks to keep sensitive values out of version control */}
