The `varlock` CLI collects **anonymous telemetry data** about usage to help us understand how the tool is being used and to make it better. Participation is optional, and you may opt-out at any time.

## What We Collect

We track general usage information, and the environment in which `varlock` is being used. Specifically we collect _anonymous_ information about:
- Which varlock command is being invoked
- Version and settings for varlock, Node.js, and any plugins
- General system/machine information
- Anonymous user + project ID

## How to Opt Out

You can opt out of analytics in two ways:

### Using the CLI

Run the following command to permanently opt out:


<ExecCommandWidget command="varlock telemetry disable" />

This will create/update a configuration file saving your preference at `~/.varlock/config.json`.

_You may re-enable telemetry by running `varlock telemetry enable`_

### Using an Environment Variable

You can also opt out temporarily by setting the `VARLOCK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable:

```bash
export VARLOCK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
```

This will disable analytics for the current session only, which is useful in CI/CD pipelines, or while running a specific command.

## Privacy
