## Repo setup 

### `.gitignore`

Depending on your setup you will want to update your `.gitignore` to _not_ ignore your `.env.schema` file and any other `.env.xxx` files that can now be safely committed to your repo if they don't contain secrets (which they shouldn't).

We also recommend that you ignore `env.d.ts` as it is dynamically generated based the hierarchy of env files being loaded on each individual machine. 

```diff title=".gitignore"
# Include .env.schema file
+!.env.schema
# Exclude env.d.ts
+env.d.ts
```

:::tip
Depending on the [AI Tools](/guides/ai-tools) you use, you may need to add a similar rule to allow `.env.schema` to be modified. For example, in `.cursorignore`.

### Monorepos

Consider how you can reuse and modularize your schema if you have a monorepo or multi-service setup. See the [Imports](/guides/import) guide for more information.

## Deployment

### CI/CD platforms

It may be useful to validate your schema in CI/CD pipelines, especially if you want to validate configurations that you don't have access to locally (e.g. Staging or Production). You can do this manually by running `varlock load` in your pipeline. And if you're using GitHub Actions, you can use the [Varlock GitHub Action](/integrations/github-action) to validate your schema automatically.

:::tip
Having a well architected multi-environment setup is key to healthy CI/CD workflows. See the [Environments](/guides/environments) guide for more information.

### Production deployments

Because varlock supports loading environment variables from the environment itself or via a [function](/reference/functions/) in your `.env.schema`, there are a few different approaches. 

If you're already using your deployment platform's environment variable management, you may not need to do anything to benefit from varlock's validation and security features. If you have a multi-environment setup, you may need to set the `currentEnv` environment flag to the correct environment.

```bash
APP_ENV=production varlock run -- your-production-command
```

If you're not using your deployment platform's environment variable management, you may consider using one of our [plugins](/plugins/overview) to securely load environment variables from a secret storage system such as [1Password](/plugins/1password/).
