description: How to integrate Varlock with Cloudflare Workers for secure, type-safe environment management
---

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) are extremely powerful, but dealing with env vars within them can be a pain.
Varlock can simplify that, providing validation, type-safety, flexible multi-environment management, and extra security guardrails to ensure you never leak a secret.

If using a framework (like Next.js) deployed on cloudflare workers, you can use the integration for that framework.

However to use varlock in a Cloudflare Workers app without a framework, you must use our [Vite integration](/integrations/vite/), along with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/). If you are not yet using their vite plugin, it is very easy to set up, and provides some [great DX improvements](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin/) to your workflow.

To set up varlock in a Cloudflare Workers application, just follow the instructions for our [Vite integration](/integrations/vite/).
