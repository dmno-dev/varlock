description: Varlock plugins overview

Plugins allow extending the functionality of Varlock. See the [plugins guide](/guides/plugins/) for more details on using plugins.

For now, only official Varlock plugins under the `@varlock` npm scope are supported. We plan to support third-party plugins in the future, along with loading plugins from different sources (e.g., local files, git, npm/jsr, http, etc.).

## Official plugins
- [1Password](/plugins/1password/)

## Roadmap

We have plans to build official plugins for most popular secret management systems, including:
- Simple encrypted vault (using local files)
- AWS Secrets Manager
- AWS Parameter Store
- GCP Secret Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- HashiCorp Vault
- Infisical
- Bitwarden
