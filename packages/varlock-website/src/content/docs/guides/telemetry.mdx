description: Learn about varlock's anonymous usage analytics and how to opt out
---

Varlock collects anonymous usage statistics to help us understand how the tool is being used and improve the product. This data is completely anonymous and is only used to make varlock better.

## What We Collect

We collect anonymous information about:
- Which commands are being used
- Basic command execution statistics
- No personal or sensitive data is ever collected

## How to Opt Out

You can opt out of analytics in two ways:

### Using the CLI

Run the following command to permanently opt out:

```bash
varlock opt-out
```

This will create a configuration file at `~/.varlock/config.json` with the opt-out setting.

### Using an Environment Variable

You can also opt out temporarily by setting the `PH_OPT_OUT` environment variable:

```bash
export PH_OPT_OUT=true
```

This will disable analytics for the current session only, which is useful in CI/CD pipelines.

## Privacy
