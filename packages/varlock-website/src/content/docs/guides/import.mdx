description: Learn how to use the @import decorator to share environment variables across files and services
---

The [`@import()` root decorator](/reference/root-decorators/#import) allows you to import schema and/or values from other sources (currently just `.env` files), making it easy to share config across services within a monorepo, split up large schemas, or reuse pre-defined schemas. Multiple `@import()` calls may be used, and an imported source may itself import more sources.

**Basic examples:**
```env-spec
# @import(./.env.imported)              # import specific file
# @import(./env-dir/)                   # import directory
# @import(./.env.partial, KEY1, KEY2)   # import specific keys
# ---
```

## Import source types

The first argument to `@import()` specifies where to look for file(s) to import.
Currently only local file imports are supported, but we plan to support importing over http in a style similar to Deno's http imports.

For now, all imported files must be `.env` files (and may contain @env-spec decorators), but in the future, we may also support other formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, etc.) or even JS/TS files.

### Single file

- Path must begin with `./` or `../` or `/`
- Imported file name must be begin with `.env.`

```env-spec
# @import(./.env.common)
```

### Directory

- Path must begin with `./` or `../` or `/`
- Path must end with a trailing `/`
- Multiple `.env.*` files will be detected and loaded, based on the current environment flag, similar to what happens in the current directory (see [environments guide](/guides/environments#loading-environment-specific-env-files))
- The environment flag value will be inherited, unless another `@currentEnv` is defined within the directory's `.env.schema`

```env-spec
# @import(../shared-config-dir/)
```

{/*
### HTTP URL (👀 coming soon)

- Protocol must be https
- File name must start with `.env.`
- If URL does not exist or is not accessible, will cause a loading error

```env-spec
# @import(https://env-schema.varlock.dev/platforms/.env.vercel)
# ---
```

### JS package registries (👀 coming soon)

A registry (npm, jsr, etc.), package name, version, and path can be used to import a schema from a public package.

```env-spec
# @import(npm:@varlock/vercel-integration@1.2.3/.env)
# ---
```
 */}

## Partial imports

By default, all items will be imported, but you may add a list of specific keys to import as additional args after the first.

- If there is a chain of imports, an item is only imported if every ancestor import includes it (or imports all items)

```env-spec
# @import(./.env.imported, KEY1, KEY2)
```

## Import precedence and merging multiple sources

Varlock is designed to load multiple definitions for a single item and merge them together.
The common case would be taking schema info from `.env.schema` and overriding a value from another source (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.),
but there are many cases where root decorators, item decorators, and descriptions may be merged as well.

To do this, we usually walk our data sources in decreasing order of precedence, until we find something defined for the value/decorator/etc we are evaluating.

**Precedence rules are:**
- Imported files are processed in order, with later imports overriding previous imports
- Definitions and root decorators in the importing file override those in files it imports
- For a directory, the precedence order is `.env.schema` < `.env` < `.env.local` < `.env.{currentEnv}` < `.env.{currentEnv}.local`

For example, given a `.env.local` and a `.env.schema` that imports 2 files:
```env-spec title=".env.schema"
# @import(./.env.import1)
# @import(./.env.import2)
# ---
```

The precedence order would be `.env.import1` < `.env.import2` < `.env.schema` < `.env.local`.

Meaning if there was a value for `ITEM` in all 4 files, the final value used would be the one from `.env.local`.


## More details
- Root decorators that affect individual items (e.g., `@defaultRequired`) affect only the items that are defined in the file, not those in imported files
- An item with no value at all (e.g., `ITEM=`) will be skipped when looking for a value / function to use, but its presence can be used to add other decorators/description to the item
- If an imported file is marked with [`@disable`](/reference/root-decorators/#disable), it and any files it imports are skipped entirely
