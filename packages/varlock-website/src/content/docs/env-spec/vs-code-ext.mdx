## Installation

The extension is available on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=varlock.env-spec-language) and [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/varlock/env-spec-language) for those who use VS Code forks like Cursor and Windsurf.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Hover info for common @decorators
- Comment continuation - automatically continue comment blocks when you hit enter within one

## How to use this extension 

The new @env-spec language mode should be enabled automatically for any .env and .env.* files, but you can always set it via the Language Mode selector in the bottom right of your editor.
