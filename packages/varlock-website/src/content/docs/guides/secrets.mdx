description: Best practices for managing secrets and sensitive environment variables with Varlock
---

One of the core use cases for Varlock is to manage secrets.

## Handling Secrets

`varlock` uses the term "sensitive" to describe any value that should not be committed to version control. This includes secrets, passwords, and other generally sensitive information.

For local development, `varlock` allows you to encrypt sensitive values in your `.env.*` files using `varlock encrypt` and then decrypt them using `varlock load` or `varlock run`.

This (currently) works exclusively for local development since it relies on encryption keys stored on your system.

We'll be adding support for cloud-based secret storage in the very near future.

## Encryption via `varlock`

1. [Install](/getting-started/installation) `varlock` including the desktop app
2. Add sensitive values to your `.env.*` file(s)
3. Encrypt them using `varlock encrypt`
4. Decrypt them using `varlock load` or `varlock run`

## Using 3rd party tools

`varlock` is compatible with any 3rd party tool that supports fetching secrets via a CLI. Using function syntax and `eval`, you can use any 3rd party tool to fetch secrets.

Here's an example using 1Password:

```bash
# A secret in 1Password
# @sensitive @required
MY_SECRET=eval(`op read "op://devTest/myVault/credential"`);
```
